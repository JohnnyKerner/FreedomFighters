    <description>Freedom Fighters is an upcoming mod for Arma Reforger, adding a new PvE game mode based on the Capture the Island concept, set in the theme of guerrilla warfare and armed uprising. It’s designed for solo play and co-op with 2 to 8 players.&#xA;It is a persistent campaign spanning from 10 to 60 hours of gameplay, depending on terrain and difficulty settings. It combines sandbox gameplay with an objective-based campaign. The goal is to capture or neutralize all enemy points of interest on the map in any order, but it can be also played infinitely due to it’s emergent gameplay style. Whether you want to conduct 8-hour long ops over several months in a persistent campaign with your squad, or jump in for a quick 30-minute supply run twice a week - both playstyles are viable.</description>
